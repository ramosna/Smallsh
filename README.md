## Compiling & Running
How to compile smallsh:

In order to compile the project, first place the files in a directory making sure that all the c files, 
header files, and the Makefile are all present.

Second run the command "make" while in the directory containing the files. 
This will create an executable called "smallsh".

In order to run the executable and the program, run the command "./smallsh".

The executable does not take anything else as an argument. You just need to run the file.
